## First MiniProject at Gothenburg/Chalmer's University
The idea for the project was given to us from a list of potential project ideas. Our approach was to go above an beyond and implement a banking system with a fully functional server in the Backend with a minimal JavaFX frontend. Therein we used Jackson JSON to save data onto files which were saved in the server via endpoints set in the backend.

Grade for the project: 5
<br> (Grading scale was from U = fail, 3 = satisfactory, 4 = excellent, 5 = exceptional!)
